# Coffee Shop Dashboard
Transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. The dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details.
To understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023. The goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.

#### Here are the questions I was interested in answering
* How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?
* Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?
* Which products are sold most and least often? Which drives the most revenue for the business?

#### I took the following steps to create my analysis
1) Downloaded data from the Maven website, conducted cleaning processes, and organized it for analytical purposes.
2) Utilized pivot tables to structure and summarize the cleaned data, facilitating easy analysis and interpretation.
3) Created charts based on the prepared data and arranged them within the dashboard tab for visualization.
4) Established slicers to enable interactive filtering across all tables, ensuring seamless data exploration.
5) Formatted each section of the dashboard and applied a cohesive theme for a visually appealing and cohesive presentation of insights.

#### Here are my key takeaways
* Astotia is the best coffee store in three stories. Only Tuesday & Saturday are low transaction rates when compared to other days.
* In Lower Manhattan, the transaction rate is high between 7 am to 10 am. Monday is the favorite day for high revenue. It is good to close at 7 pm because sales are very low between 7 pm and 8 pm.
* Coffee, Tea, and Bakery are the high revenue generators.
* Coffee beans, Loose Tea, Branded and packaged chocolate performed very poorly.
* Brewed Chai tea is the best product in all three cities.
