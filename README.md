Transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. The dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details.
To understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023. The goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.

#### Understanding requirements:
* How have Maven Roasters sales trended over time?
* Which days of the week tend to be busiest, and why do you think that's the case?
* Which products are sold most and least often? Which drives the most revenue for the business?

#### Insights
* Astotia is the best coffee store in three stories.Only Tuesday & Saturday are low transaction rates when compared to other days.
* In Lower Manhattan, the transaction rate is high between 7 am to 10 am. Monday is the favorite day for high revenue. It is good to close at 7 pm because sales are very low between 7 pm and 8 pm.
* Coffee, Tea, and Bakery are the high revenue generators.
* Coffee beans, Loose Tea, Branded and packaged chocolate performed very poorly.
* Brewed Chai tea is the best product in all three cities.
